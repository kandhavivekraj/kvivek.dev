          I'm currently working as a Senior FrontEnd engineer at Zoho, where i will be writing and managing code for core modules of a finance application (Zoho Books). I used to code in EmberJS and React.

          I built user friendly applications by collobrating with UX and UI teams and i love giving more importance to performance as key metric while developing applications.
          <br/><br/>
